This is a coding platform for evaluation of the training and testing dataset for machine learning potentials in interfaced materials, which consists of two dissimilar materials. 
I have added some codes in python related to calculating TBC (Thermal boundary conductance) of A/B interface materials(Data are from LAMMPS simulations),
training and test database creation from total.cfg type data file (First principle calculations), 
and DFT MTP potential energy, forces and stresses difference code as well.
Currently the dataset is for MTP from MLIP (Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials). hopefully, I will try to add other type of data in different potential packages data post processing as well.
